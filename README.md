# go-httpsign
Go middleware for signing and verifying http requests via HMAC SHA256.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RobotsAndPencils/go-httpsign.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/RobotsAndPencils/go-httpsign)

### Installing

    go get github.com/RobotsAndPencils/go-httpsign

### Using

    key := []byte("this is your key")
    hs := httpsign.New(key)

Using a custom header name:

    hs.HeaderName = "X-WHATEVERYOUWANT"

The library verifies that the time difference between generation of the signature and the time the server received the request is within reason. The default allows `6` seconds difference between client and server but is configurable:

    hs.SecondsAllowance = 10    // to set to 10 seconds

You can specify a "log hook" function that gets called whenever a failure happens in the Verify() handler.  This helps
debugging deployments when keys and clocks do not match up.  The request is passed to the handler so that information
can be pulled from it to form a more helpful log message.

    hs.LookHook = func(r *http.Request, msg string) {
        log.Printf("HTTPSIGN ERROR: %s\n", msg)
    }

#### A client making a signed request

    // content is the value of the content to sign
    // It must be something you send, like another header that is
    // agreed upon
    content := "the value of the content you will sign"
    header := hs.GenerateHeaderValue(content)
    req, err = http.NewRequest("GET", url, nil)
    req.Header.Set(hs.HeaderName, header)
    resp, err = http.DefaultClient.Do(req)


#### A server receiving a request

    // Assume you are sending the content to be signed as a header
    // named `REQUEST-ID`
    getValue := func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) string {
        return r.Header.Get("REQUEST-ID")
    }

    h := http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // your foo http handler
    })

    http.Handle("/foo", hs.Verify(h, getValue))


#### Testing

    key := []byte("does not matter")
    hs := httpsign.New(key)
    hs.DisableVerify = true

Adding the Verify() middleware can make it really annoying to test a local service.  You can optionally set
`DisableVerify` to `true` in order to simplify the Verify() handler such that it always determines the request is valid,
regardless whether the signaturate header is valid or even present.
